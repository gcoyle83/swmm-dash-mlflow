title: "Containerization"
---

Package and environment management is necessary but insufficient to ensure reproducible projects. Environments run on operating systems, which run on real or virtual machines. Containerization is a technology developed to support reproducibility and virtualization (at scale) of operating systems. The leading tools for containerization of Python (or, really, any development) projects are Docker and Kubernetes.
