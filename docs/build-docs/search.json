    "text": "Automatic linting and formatting with Pylint and black\nIt is important but tedious to follow formatting standards. Automated tools have been developed by those who agree with this statement (starting at Bell Labs almost 50 years ago). A linter is a tool for static code analysis used to flag programming errors, bugs, stylistic errors and suspicious constructs. Pylint is one such tool that is widely used for Python to enforce the PEP8 Style Guide. Black is another, and these two tools are often used in parallel to get the most benefit. The following steps will help you understand how to use these tools to improve your Python projects:\n\nUse Pylint to analyze the code in the src folder:\npylint src\nThis command will analyze all *.py files in the src folder. Note that the output to the terminal includes recommendations to include docstrings for modules and functions, and another recommendation to improve efficiency of the python_version function in version.py.\nNone of these recommendations are compliance issues, and they can be suppressed. Note the overall score is 4.62/10. Suppressing these recommendations with the --disable flag:\npylint --disable=R,C src\n\nNote, --disable=R,C indicates that ‘refactor’ and ‘convention’ messages should be disabled The resulting output should now have no suggestions, and the overall rating is 10/10\n\nFinally, only errors can be reported by passing the --errors-only flag\npylint --errors-only src\nNote the rating is no longer returned. Try introducing an error into a module and run again to see what happens.\nNow use black to autoformat your Python code to PEP8 compliance. Black is “an opinionated strict subset of PEP8”. While Pylint can be used to generate a set of recommendations or flag errors, Black can be used to automatically enforce formatting conventions:\n\nFirst, open hello.py and paste the following function into the end of the module:\ndef my_func(x):\n    \"\"\"\n    This is my function it returns the product of `x` and `a`\n    \"\"\"\n    a = [\n        1,2,3\n    ]\n    return a*x\nNow run the command black src, and open hello.py again. Note the input has been reformatted to:\ndef my_func(x):\n    \"\"\"\n    This is my function it returns the product of `x` and `a`\n    \"\"\"\n    a = [1, 2, 3]\n    return a * x\n\n\nBy using first Black and then Pylint in succession, much of the tedium of code review can be avoided and errors can be caught and corrected before committing."

    "text": "Trunk-based Development, Branch Protections and Continuous Integration\nTrunk-based development is a development practice meant to support change management. As a project’s codebase changes over time, it is important to control the scope of any single set of changes, so that they can be thoroughly tested before merging and so that they can be rolled back in the event of unforeseen consequences. The concept is relatively simple:\n\nThe main branch of a repo represents “production-ready” code, i.e., the best currently available implementation of the project’s goals\nAny new feature (a new function, a better version of a function, etc) is implemented in a feature branch, which begins as an exact copy of the current state of the main branch\nWhen a new feature is developed, it is tested and then merged via Pull Request. A Pull Request (PR) is a request from one branch (feature branch) to another branch (main) requesting that main pull the changes from the feature branch and commit them. Using PRs that are generated after fully testing the new feature is the standard way of preventing any untested changes from polluting the production/main branch (aside - the ‘production’ branch need not always be named main: for instance, several branches may host production versions of code serving different project requirements - e.g., a “baseline” version may be served from main while other scenarios are served from scenario_n branches).\n\nBranch protections are a set of configuration options that can be specified in GitHub for each branch of the repository. This feature enables best practices like preventing changes to the repo’s main branch except by an approved Pull Request originating from another branch, which helps prevent untested changes from creeping into your production code. When working on projects with more than a few trusted collaborators, it becomes very important to implement branch protections and continuous integration practices."
